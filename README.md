# hunterio-cli
Hi! I'm [@LocCode](https://twitter.com/loccode) and one of my friends asked me to make a simple script in Python
which may help him to work with Hunter.io website.

I started to practise programming in Python and as a result,
I want to present this non-official CLI version of Hunter.io.

All you need is to get the API-key from Hunter.io at put it into the hunter_io variable,
check the requirements.txt file, then run this script with parameters:
E.g.: -d domain.com -l 100

After that, you will get a .txt file with 100 emails for the website domain.com.

Thank you for reading and using this,
With best regards @LocCodE!
